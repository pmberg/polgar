    <h1>The POLGAR Project</h1>
    <p>
      A website about practically oriented learning for general alignment
      research, across a wide range of areas.

      <h2 class="core"><a href="sections/core.html">Core</a></h2>
      <p>
        Core material is focused on basic technical content useful for all sorts
        of professionals, as well as core AI safety content useful for all
        different applications.
      </p>

        <a href="sections/technical.html">Technical Alignment</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Technical Alignment content is content that is useful in both
        theoretical and engineering applications, but may not be as useful in
        policy/governance. However, it is more likely to come in handy in a
        policy/governance context than Theoretical or Engineering content is.
      </p>

    <div class="fadesection">
      <h2 class="engineering">
        <a href="sections/engineering.html">Engineering</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Engineering content is focused on practical implementation of AI safety
        mechanisms, including technical safeguards, testing methodologies, and
        robustness measures.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="fadesection">
      <h2 class="theoretical">
        <a href="sections/theoretical.html">Theoretical</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Theoretical content is focused on theoretical alignment research,
        focused more on resolving unsolved fundamental problems in the MLAI
        space than on developing alignment technologies for current systems.
      </p>

    <div class="fadesection">
      <h2 class="governance">
        <a href="sections/governance.html">Governance</a>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Governance content addresses policy frameworks, institutional design,
        and coordination mechanisms for ensuring safe and beneficial AI
        development.
